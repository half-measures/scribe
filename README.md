## Overview

Scribe fits into your existing Git workflow in different ways:

- **CLI** — Generate commit messages from any terminal.
- **Git Hook** — Integrate with `git commit` and generate messages automatically.
- **VS Code Extension** — Generate commit messages directly from the Source Control panel.

The CLI is the core of the project, while the VS Code extension provides a native experience for VS Code users.

Scribe analyzes your staged changes and suggests commit message candidates.

scribe config --help
```

## Git Hook Integration

```bash
scribe hook install
```

Remove the hook:

```bash
scribe hook uninstall
```

## Ignoring Files

You can create a `.scribeignore` file in the root of your repository to ignore specific files or patterns from being processed by Scribe (similar to `.gitignore`):

```text
# Ignore lockfiles and generated files
*.lock
docs/*.md
vendor/
```

## Performance

Scribe caches responses for identical staged diffs using SHA-256, reducing unnecessary LLM requests.

Cache location:

```text
~/.scribe_cache.json
```
